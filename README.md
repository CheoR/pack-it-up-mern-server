# PackItUpMern

[PackItUpMern] is my frontend capstone project redone using the MERN stack.

The original [PackItUp](https://cr-demo--packitup.netlify.app) is a moving/storage CRUD app created with

- React
- HTML
- CSS
- Fetch API
- json-server

to help users inventorize items they pack into boxes for moving/storage.

[![V1 Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-PackItUp-green)](https://cr-demo--packitup.netlify.app), [github](https://github.com/CheoR/pack-it-up-api) repo.

Initial design made with Figma and the entity relational diagram made with diagramdb.io.

Issue tickets follow [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development#Behavioral_specifications), Behavior-Driven Development and use Github Project board to track issue lifecyles.

## Cloning

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CheoR/pack-it-up-mern-server.git
cd pack-it-up-mern
npm install
```

## Running Tests

After forking the repo.

```bash

git fetch --all
git checkout <branch-name>
npm install
npm start

```

In another tab, cd into `api` and run

`json-server -p 8088 database.json`

Please note, as of right now, running the above command including `-w` would cause json-serve to crash if user chooses to create 4 or more objects at once through the `ADD` button.

## Roadmap

- [_] Encode item/box/move data as a QR code that can be printed out as a label for shipping.
- [_] Add a complentary QR decoding, so user can scan QR on a box and get information about its contents (if user has authorization). User can limit what data 3rd parties (movers, storage management, ect) can see.
